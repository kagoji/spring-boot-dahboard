## Introduction

The Spring Boot Dashboard is a convenient tool for managing and monitoring Spring Boot applications directly from your integrated development environment (IDE). It simplifies tasks like starting, stopping, and monitoring your Spring Boot applications.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Spring Boot Dashboard, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

* [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://adoptium.net/)
* A compatible IDE with Spring Boot Dashboard support (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse with Spring Tools Suite)
* Spring Boot applications to manage

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start using the Spring Boot Dashboard.

## Installation

1. Open your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

2. Install the Spring Boot Dashboard plugin or extension if it's not already installed. Refer to your IDE's documentation for instructions on how to install plugins.

## Configuration

No specific configuration is required for the Spring Boot Dashboard. It automatically detects Spring Boot applications within your project workspace.

- Using the Dashboard

Once you have the Spring Boot Dashboard installed, you can perform various actions on your Spring Boot applications.

## Starting and Stopping Applications

1. Launch the Spring Boot Dashboard from your IDE's menu or toolbar.

2. In the dashboard, you will see a list of your Spring Boot applications.

3. To start an application, select it from the list and click the "Start" button.

4. To stop an application, select it from the list and click the "Stop" button.

## Viewing Logs

Some Spring Boot Dashboards provide the ability to view application logs:

1. Select an application from the dashboard.

2. Look for an option to view logs. You can typically view log files or real-time log output.
